## üî∞ Beginner-Level React Questions (1‚Äì25)

1. **What is React?**
   A JavaScript library by Meta for building user interfaces with a component-based architecture.

2. **What are components in React?**
   Independent, reusable pieces of UI. Can be class or functional components.

3. **What is JSX?**
   JavaScript XML ‚Äì syntax extension that looks like HTML and is used to describe UI.

4. **Difference between class and functional components?**

   * Class: Uses `class`, lifecycle methods.
   * Functional: Uses hooks, simpler syntax.

5. **What is a state in React?**
   An object that holds data that influences output and behavior.

6. **What are props?**
   Inputs to components; passed from parent to child.

7. **Difference between props and state?**
   Props are immutable; state is mutable and managed inside the component.

8. **What is the virtual DOM?**
   Lightweight in-memory copy of the real DOM that React updates efficiently.

9. **Why use React?**
   Fast rendering, component reusability, strong community, virtual DOM, hooks.

10. **How to create a React app?**
    Using `npx create-react-app my-app`.

    A toolchain to scaffold React projects with zero config.

12. **Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components?**

    * Controlled: Form data handled by state.
    * Uncontrolled: Form data handled by DOM refs.

13. **How to handle forms in React?**
    Use state to control input values and handle submit events.

14. **What is conditional rendering?**
    Render different UI elements based on conditions (`if`, ternary, etc.).

15. **What are React fragments?**
    Used to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes (`<> </>`).

16. **What is a key prop?**
    A unique identifier to help React identify which items have changed.

17. **What is a synthetic event?**
    A cross-browser wrapper around native events.

18. **How to pass data from parent to child?**
    Using props: `<Child name="mystry" />`.

19. **How to pass data from child to parent?**
    Via callback function: `props.onData(data)`.

20. **What are default props?**
    Default values for props if none are passed: `Component.defaultProps`.

21. **What is `useState()`?**
    Hook to add local state to functional components.

22. **What is `useEffect()`?**
    Hook to handle side effects like fetching, timers, etc.

23. **What is prop drilling?**
    Passing props through many layers unnecessarily.

24. **How to avoid prop drilling?**
    Use Context API or state management libraries.

25. **What is the purpose of `render()`?**
    Returns UI to be rendered (used in class components).

45. **What are custom hooks?**
    Reusable functions that use other hooks.

46. **How to create a custom hook?**
    Prefix function with `use`, call hooks inside it.

47. **Local vs Global state?**

49. **What is Redux?**
    Predictable state container using actions, reducers, and store.

50. **What are actions in Redux?**
    JS objects describing what to do (`type`, `payload`).

51. **What are reducers?**
    Pure functions to change state based on actions.

52. **What is the Redux store?**
    Centralized state container.

53. **What is `connect()` in Redux?**

59. **How to fetch API data in React?**

60. **What is `useLayoutEffect()`?**
    Similar to `useEffect()` but runs synchronously after DOM changes.

## üöÄ Advanced-Level React Questions (61‚Äì85)
