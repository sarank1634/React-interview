1. What is the difference between React and React Native?
React is for building web applications. React Native is for building mobile applications using the same component model.

2. What is a Pure Component?
A Pure Component performs a shallow comparison on props and state to determine if a re-render is needed.

3. What are forward refs in React?
forwardRef is used to pass a ref through a component to access a DOM node or child component.

4. How does React batching work?
React batches multiple state updates into a single re-render for performance optimization.

5. What is the role of keys in dynamic children?
Keys help React identify and manage individual elements during reconciliation, preventing unnecessary re-renders.

6. What is the difference between mount, update, and unmount phases?

Mount: Component is created and inserted into the DOM.

Update: Component updates due to state/props change.

Unmount: Component is removed from the DOM.

7. What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled forms in React?
Controlled forms are fully managed by React state. Uncontrolled forms use refs to access DOM values.

8. What is the use of useRef()?
useRef returns a mutable ref object which persists across renders. Often used to access DOM nodes or store mutable values.

9. How can we prevent unnecessary re-renders in React?
Use React.memo, useMemo, useCallback, and avoid updating state unnecessarily.

10. How to lazy load images or components in React?
Use React.lazy() for components and libraries like react-lazyload or native loading="lazy" attribute for images.
